# Population-data-generator-and-classifier

Project to create a random generator which creates realistic population data (e.g. age, sex, height, education ...) in order to generate training data. 
The generator is intended to represent the population of Germany and should be as realistic as possible.
It is partly based on real data and observed correlations (sources are given), but many implementations are not based on real data, but on assumptions and estimates by me.

#### !!! Please do not treat this generator as representative !!!

In a second step those generated data is used to train neural networks or decision trees and evaluate their quality.
